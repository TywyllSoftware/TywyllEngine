# TywyllEngine
OpenGL Game Engine  that will work in the future... maybe... when will fix problems with architecture and renderer.......


#ThirdParty libraries used
>-Bullet3 - For Physics
>-FreeType - For font rendering
>-Glew - OpenGL
>-Glm - For Math but not used in this engine as I have my own math library (worst mistake I ever did in my life......)
>-Lua - For running Lua Script
>-LuaSol2 - For running LuaScript (it uses Lua)
>-TinyXml2 - For Xml Parsing
>-Zlib - the name says it all
